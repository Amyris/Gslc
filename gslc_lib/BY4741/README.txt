This BY4741 reference was created by mapping reads from the short read archive
with bwa/samtools and integrating SNPs into release 64 of the S288C
genome.  This is released without warranty, and generated DNA should be
experimentally verified.  Note, we did not resolve large differences between
the S288C and BY4741 strains, particularly mating loci.
